# Abstract 
This project was designed to classify images of dogs and cats. The two methods implemented were Random Forests 
using scikit-learn and Convolutional Nueral Networks using Keras. The documentation for scikit-learn random
forests can be found here: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ and for Keras: https://keras.io/

# Dataset
The dataset for this project was downloaded from Kaggle and can be found here:
